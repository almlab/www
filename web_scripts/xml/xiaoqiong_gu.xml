        <h4> Research Interests </h4>

        I am interested in the relationship between the viromes, human-inducted factors and public health in the city based ecosystem. Briefly, my research area keywords include: viral metagenomics, microbial ecology, virus-host interactions and water quality. I am also interested in expanding the virome database and discovering novel viruses/phages by wet lab and bioinformatics analysis. In the future, I would like to apply the viral metagenomics not only in environmental samples, but also human clinical samples, to capture the virome patterns in these clinical samples and correlate with human disease.
