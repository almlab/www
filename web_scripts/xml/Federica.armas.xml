        <h4>Research Interests</h4>
I am passionate about the damned and blessed tiny beings, also called bacteria. The ones that can cause infection and the "good ones" that keep our body healthy. I am particularly interested in infectious diseases, especially those that can spread from animals to humans, and their importance in public health.  My field of expertise ranges from the mycobacteria to probiotics. I have always focused on a single, one person, one animal, but now, I am moving my attention to a population level, looking at a neighbourhood or entire cities. I am excited to work with the Alm Singaporean group to look into into new wastewater population biomarkers to study public health in cities that will help us predict an infectious disease outbreak to act promptly and maintain our population health. I am fascinated by the idea of answering the question, "is the population healthy?"

        <h4>Something else about me</h4>
        "How can a population be more healthy?". To answer this question, I am looking to learn more about the amazing challenge of human behaviour. How we interact with each other and how we can have good relationships. I am interested in the communication challenges that we are facing every day. As Italian, I feel very excited to be in Asia, knowing more about human habits here and being part of a multicultural group like the Alm's one.
