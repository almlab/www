       	The sequencing revolution has immense promises for improving human health. In the Alm lab, I have the opportunity to apply cutting edge genomic technique to study the interplay of microbes and human diseases. One of my current work is to study the mechanism of how fecal microbiota transplant treated recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, from an ecological perspective. I am also interested in diving into the metagenomics data to characterize the dynamics of perturbed microbiome, and trying to find biomarkers for easy diagnostics. Moreover, I am involved in the Personal analytics project, which collects time-series orthogonal physiological data to enhance our understandings of chronic diseases.
