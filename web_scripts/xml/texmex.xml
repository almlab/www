    DESCRIPTION <br/>
    TEXMEX is an R package designed to help visualize and interpret community dynamics observed
    in microbial ecology experiments that use sequencing count data. Given one inoculum split
    into two replicates, one control and one experimental, which OTUs are growing or shrinking
    in response to the treatment? TEXMEX is designed to help account for changes in the control
    unit's community composition as well as dampen compositional effects that might occur in
    either unit.
