        <h4>Research Interests</h4>
        Microbial communities play a pivotal role in human and animal productivity as well as overall wellbeing. Understanding and modelling the naturally occurring complex microbial communities of gut and indigenously fermented foods and might have a potential to enhance the productivity and prevent various diseases. I'm interested in the development of food and feed based bio-therapeutics with wide array of applications for human and animals. More precisely, the areas of interests are:
        <h5>Understanding the Microbial Diversity of Indigenous Fermented Foods and Human Gut.</h5>
        <h5>Development of Biotherapeutics for humans and animals.</h5>
        <h5>Formulation of microbial starters for antagonism and detoxification in food ecosystem.</h5>

        <h4>Teaching interests</h4>
        I teach subjects related to microbiology, especially Food and Nutrition and industrial microbiology at Graduate and undergraduate level.
