<a href="dbc.html">Distribution-based operational taxonomic unit-calling (dbOTU) </a>
improves on other approaches by incorporating information about the input sequences' distribution
across samples. Previous implementations of dbOTU presented challenges for users. dbOTU3 is a new
implementation of dbOTU that is faster and more user-friendly.
For a treatment of the theoretical and practical improvements over previous implementations of dbOTU,
please refer to our bioRxiv paper (in preparation).<p/>

The original dbOTU algorithm was developed by Sarah Preheim and used to process Illumina Genome
Analyzer II reads for 16S rRNA sequence analysis in this paper:
